# de.htwg.roulette

Project in software engineering.  
We implemented French Roulette in Java using everything we learned during the Semester.  
The projects architecture is MVC.  
Logic of the game is placed in the model. GUI and TUI run beside.  

If you want to start the game, start it in the class Roulette (package Roulette). From there, everything is called.  
The GUI and the TUI both have a help me method. On the command line use help and in the GUI press the button "Please Help Me".
